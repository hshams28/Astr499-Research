# Astr499-Research

This Repository was created to share my work done during my time working as an Astronomy Undergraduate researcher for the UW DIRAC-LSST team.

I have segregated my files that lead to the final product in the "Preliminary work" folder, and my final notebook is in the "Final notebook" folder. 
The data files are not in my repository, and they will not be added in the future as they are a part of the LSST collaboration. 

I would like to thank my mentor John Parajko for the opportunity to conduct real life work, and for guiding me along the way. 

I would also like to thank Andy Connolly for Sponsoring my research credits as well as connecting me with my mentor, and being a great professor and adviser!
